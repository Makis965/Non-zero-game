# Non-zero-game

Function allows to calculate the pure Nash equilibrium in minimization process, based on the decission matrices. 
It takes arrays of matrices for both of players as an input (P1, P2 defines the players, where player 1. decides as the first one). 
As an output it results in the costs found for the first equilibrium..
